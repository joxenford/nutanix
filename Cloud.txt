Datacenter architectures are evolving along multiple dimensions. Broad acceptance of public cloud infrastructures (e.g., IaaS and SaaS) enables enterprises to build hybrid cloud datacenters, which fuse public and private cloud resources. At the same time, the growth in virtual workloads is motivating IT teams to embrace multiple virtualization technologies to lessen any dependence upon a single virtual ‘stack.’ Nutanix has designed its Virtual Computing Platform for hybrid deployments. Its distributed software architecture is completely hypervisor agnostic. Nutanix customers, for example, can run vSphere virtual machines (VMs) adjacent to KVM-based VMs to facilitate mixed workload environments. Similarly, Nutanix is built to function independently of storage media. Besides storing data using local high-capacity hard disk drives and advanced solid-state flash, the Nutanix architecture is extensible. It will enable easy consumption of public clouds via standards-based APIs to build seamless hybrid cloud environments.
