If you are curious how I am accomplishing what seems to be an interactive web console<br>
without having the web console accessing an actual Nutanix cluster, I am simply using<br>
images, or screen captures, and creating clickable areas (imagemaps for the hardcore<br>
geeks) that link to other pages with images. This is also why the screen may appear<br>
to shift around occasionally.
<p>
Because of this, and the fact that this type of thing is not my job and I am doing this<br>
in my spare time as a way to show people the Nutanix Prism interface without the worry<br>
of said system being botched up in any way, the functionality at any given moment may<br>
be very limited and subject to change!
<p>
If you are viewing this on a laptop/desktop computer in a browser, your task of figuring<br>
out what works will be MUCH easier. Simply hover the pointer over any item in the image<br>
and if it changes to a hand, you can click on that item and it will do something.
<p>
If you are using a mobile device like a phone or tablet, then you will have to resort to<br>
trial and error to locate items that will have an action associated with it. Hunt and peck. ;-)
<p>
Also keep in mind that, because each and every action is a new page and image, some things<br> 
may take substantially longer to load than would happen on an actual working Nutanix<br>
cluster's Web Console. If I have more free time, or help from others, I will attempt<br>
to make this much more user friendly and functional.
