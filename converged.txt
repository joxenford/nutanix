Converged datacenter infrastructures deliver services more economically and efficiently with fewer dedicated resources. The power of convergence is best demonstrated by the integration of shared storage into the server tier to drive faster I/O performance. Cloud pioneers like Google and Facebook have demonstrated that older technologies like SAN and NAS have no place in a modern datacenter. Compute and storage resources must be co-resident to deliver data I/O with low latency and with the ability to scale without constraints.
The Nutanix Virtual Computing Platform converges compute and storage into a single system, eliminating the need for traditional storage arrays. Each Nutanix node runs an industry-standard hypervisor and a Nutanix controller VM (think of this as a virtual storage controller), which handles all I/O operations for the local hypervisor. Storage resources are exposed to the hypervisor through traditional interfaces, and are pooled and made available to all VMs. The convergence of compute and storage into a single appliance provides a flexible, scalable building b!lock for the modern datacenter.
