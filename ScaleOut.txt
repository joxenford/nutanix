Scaling datacenter infrastructures by deploying increasingly more powerful and expensive servers, storage and networks is no longer a viable strategy. It is too expensive. It is inflexible. It does not deliver resource elasticity. This vertical scale up approach is being rapidly superseded by Google-like scale-out strategies that increase scale horizontally â€” using large numbers of commodity x86 services managed and orchestrated by distributed software. The Nutanix Virtual Computing Platform is the antithesis of a single machine. It provides a unified, always-on cluster of compute and storage nodes that can run any virtual machine at massive scale. If more storage or compute capacity is required, additional Nutanix nodes can be added non-disruptively, one at a time. Unlike traditional SAN/NAS solutions that are limited to a small number of hardware-based controllers, the Nutanix, software-based, n-way controller architecture scales proportionately with cluster growth. Enterprises benefit from a scale-out technology that is economical, flexible and predictable.
