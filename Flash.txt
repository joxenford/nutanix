With dramatically faster I/O performance than traditional hard disk drives (HDD), flash technology is rapidly pushing into mainstream datacenter architectures. Flash-based storage, however, must be placed as close as possible to the compute tier in order to fully utilize its performance advantages. The benefits of flash are degraded when data is separated from the application/server tier by a storage network, which can often bottleneck performance. Server-attached flash must also provide an elastic storage resource for the entire infrastructure, not just for the workloads running on that physical server. The Nutanix Virtual Computing Platform integrates enterprise-grade flash into each node — converging flash and compute resources into a single appliance to deliver the fastest possible application performance. The Nutanix Distributed File System pools server-attached flash capacity across all Nutanix nodes into a single shared resource that is accessible to all virtual machines in the cluster. Unlike competing flash-based storage solutions, Nutanix maintains a fully persistent data tier in flash – not just a cached copy. The Virtual Computing Platform also distributes metadata intelligently throughout the flash tier to enable massive and truly linear scale-out.
