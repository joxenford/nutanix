A software-defined solution is one that de-couples policy control from the hardware substrate. Intelligence is abstracted into a distributed software layer, rather than being ‘baked’ into specialized hardware, for programmatic control and simpler centralized management. Enterprise data storage is an emerging software-defined service that delivers greater flexibility, improved agility and superior economics than traditional storage solutions whose feature sets are tightly coupled to hardware. The Nutanix Virtual Computing Platform employs a highly distributed software architecture to deliver enterprise data storage as an on-demand service. The system embeds all control logic into intelligent virtual machines that run on each cluster node. As a 100% software-driven solution, all Nutanix services are ‘late bound.’ Policy controls are never tied to hardware. Additionally, all software-defined services are entirely VM-centric, including snapshots, high availability, disaster recovery, de-duplication and more. The Nutanix Virtual Computing Platform transforms storage from a passive keeper of data to into an active system.
